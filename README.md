## Description

This project is a README.md generator app that provides a wizard that walks the user through a serious of questions that are common on a professional readme. This project is designed for professional developers to allow a quick way to create a professional readme file so the developer can spend more time on writing code instead of writing a readme. How this project is ran is in the terminal with the command 'node index.js' and enter, once the project is ran the user will be walked through a serious of questions which will be rendered onto the readme doc. My most challenging moment of this project was learning to get all the functions working together and bringing the files together to work between one another as well as writing some of the functions, but once I overcame these challenges everything started to click.
